# STM32F446 Bootloader

This repository contains a custom bootloader for the STM32F446 microcontroller, developed as part of a signal acquisition unit for a rainwater retention system. The bootloader enables robust firmware management, including dual-slot fallback, CRC integrity checks, and in-application programming (IAP) via UART or RS485.

It is a core component of a distributed embedded system designed for diagnostics, monitoring, and control in harsh environments. The bootloader is tightly integrated with the application firmware, GUI uploader, and hardware test routines.

## üöÄ Features

### üîÅ Dual-Slot Architecture
- Supports two application slots (APP1 and APP2)
- Bootloader verifies CRC of APP1 on startup
- If APP1 fails or is missing, it falls back to APP2
- Ensures system reliability during firmware updates or corruption

### üîê CRC Integrity Verification
- Uses STM32 hardware CRC peripheral
- Each application image includes a CRC appended at the end
- Bootloader calculates CRC before jumping to application

### üîß Vector Table Relocation
- Uses `SCB->VTOR` to remap the interrupt vector table to the application base address
- Ensures correct interrupt handling after bootloader jump

### üîÑ In-Application Programming (IAP)
- Receives `.bin` firmware files over UART or RS485
- Parses 240-byte packets with headers and CRC
- Writes to Flash using `LL_FLASH_Program()` and verifies each block
- Compatible with GUI uploader and RS485 upload test firmware

### üß± CMSIS LL Driver Integration
- LL_USART for UART/RS485 communication
- LL_FLASH for Flash programming
- LL_CRC for checksum validation
- LL_GPIO for boot pin logic (optional)

## üìä Firmware Architecture

### üß≠ Bootloader Flow

The bootloader supports dual-slot firmware management with CRC validation and UART/RS485-based in-application programming. It verifies the integrity of App1 and App2 and jumps accordingly.

### üß† Application Flow with IAP (APP1/APP2)

In this version, the application itself can receive and flash new firmware using DMA and UART/RS485, without rebooting into the bootloader. This is ideal for remote updates in distributed systems.
